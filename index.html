        <aside>Really it is</aside>

        <h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>

          <p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB motherfuckingwebsite(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>
          <p><span class="wrong "> WRONG</span>, motherfucker</p>


        <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>

            <p> Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past motherfuckingwebsites:</p>
        <h2>A little less contrastt</h2>

            <p>Black on white. How often do yu see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if A wasn't so focused on keeping to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>

        <h2>Size Matters</h2>

            <p> I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not for screen</p>

        <h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>

            <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>

        <h3>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h3>

          <p>I love what the creator of<a href="motherfuckingwebsite.com">  this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
